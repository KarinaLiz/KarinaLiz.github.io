       <h3> The Basic </h3>
        <p> It opened on October 1, 1971 (That's why its 50th anniversary is being celebrated). It is the first Walt Disney World park. It has 6 lands  (divisions in the park). It measures 142 acres (0.57 km) (0.22 miles). Currently contains 76 things to do (atractions, entertainment, shows, stores, dining, etc). It has a train that runs around the entire park (it is currently closed and it is not known when it will reopen). </p>
        <h3> Present </h3>
          <p> As it is important and interesting to look back and foward in time, it is also important to know what is going on in the present time. Especially now since many entertainment and changes are going on. </p>
