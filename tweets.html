        <h3> Basic </h3>
        <p> It opened on October 1, 1982. It is the second Walt Disney World park. It has 4 lands  (divisions in the park), however, with the parks reimagining, most of these will change names. It measures  acres ( km) ( miles). Currently contains  things to do (atractions, entertainment, shows, stores, dining, etc). It has a monorail that runs around the entire park and to other locations such as thru a hotel. </p>
        <h3> Present </h3>
          <p> As years go by, the Disney parks have changed from small look changes to attraction retirements to add new ones. This year it is not an exception. </p>

        <h3> 50th anniversary celebration in the park </h3>
        <h4> Fab 50 </h4>
          <p> Fab 50 is a collection of golden statues of Disney characters located around the 4 Walt Disney World theme parks. Some of these are easy to spot but some others are a little more trickier to find. Also, Magic Kingdom has the most statues since the celebrations purpose is that park. In Magic Kingdom, there is a total of 10 statues. </p>
        <h4> Beacon of Magic </h4>

          <p> After nightfall, Spaceship Earth (name of the attraction inside the sphere) is iluminated with Eardescent colors (it is available most nights). </p>
        <h4>  </h4>
            <p> A calvacade is a short version of a parade since there are only a few floats and it ends faster. Disney has used them for some time now. </p>
